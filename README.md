ROOT by RHU is a study abroad app for students developed at CSSI LMU 2017 by Keanna Anglin, Talia Bahar, and Breelyn Betts.
It was created to help students studying abroad maximize their experience and feel equipped to handle their new surroundings through various location recommendations organized by interest, cultural queues, transportation information, and tips from their fellow classmates.
